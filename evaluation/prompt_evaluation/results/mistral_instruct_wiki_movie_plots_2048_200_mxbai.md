Query: What personal struggle does Juror 3 face that influences his final decision?
Response:  In the film "12 Angry Men," Juror 3 faces a personal struggle with his own feelings towards his estranged son, which influences his final decision. Throughout the movie, it is established that Juror 3 had a bad relationship with his son. When the jury is deliberating on the verdict, Juror 3 becomes emotional and weeps as he presents his arguments, stating that he can feel the knife being plunged into his chest. This emotional response suggests that Juror 3 may be projecting his own feelings of guilt and regret about his relationship with his son onto the defendant, who is also a young man from a troubled home. In the end, Juror 8 points out to him that the boy is not his son, and Juror 4 comforts him by saying "Let him live." This allows Juror 3 to overcome his personal struggle and agree with the unanimous verdict of acquittal.

Response:  Based on the information you provided about the movie "Adrenalin: Fear the Rush," it does not seem to have many scenes involving fast cars or explosions, as it is primarily a science fiction film focused on a mysterious virus and a creature that causes havoc in Boston.

If you are looking for movies with fast cars and explosions, here are some suggestions:

1. Fast & Furious series (2001-present) - This franchise revolves around illegal street racing and heists, featuring high-speed car chases and numerous explosions.
2. The Transporter series (2002-2008) - These action films follow a professional driver who transports valuable cargo but often gets caught up in dangerous situations involving gunfights and explosions.
